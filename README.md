# HyperCasual-2DPlatform-Game
Hello! This readme file is designed to provide information about the 2D platformer game I have developed.

# Game Description
This game is a 2D platformer. In the game, you can control the character by tapping to the right or left sides of the screen. There is a platform in the middle of the game, and you need to stand on these platforms and jump higher. However, one important detail to note is that these platforms collapse after a certain period.

# How to Play
You can play the game using the following controls:

To jump to the right, tap the right side of the screen.
To jump to the left, tap the left side of the screen.

Use the platforms to progress in the game and be mindful of their collapse.
